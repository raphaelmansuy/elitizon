# Fixing AWS SES Issues - Complete Guide

This guide explains how to fix the AWS SES configuration issues you're experiencing.

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: NODE_ENV Configuration Issue
**Problem**: You had `NODE_ENV=production` set in your `.env` files, which caused Next.js to show a warning.

**Solution**: Removed the manual `NODE_ENV` setting. Next.js automatically sets this based on the command used (`npm run dev` = development, `npm run build` = production).

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Next.js Configuration Issue  
**Problem**: The `telemetry: false` property in `next.config.ts` is not valid.

**Solution**: Removed the invalid `telemetry` property. Use `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` in your environment variables instead.

### 3. üîß NEEDS ATTENTION: AWS SES Sandbox Mode Issue

**Problem**: AWS SES is in "sandbox mode" which means:
- You can only send emails FROM verified email addresses
- You can only send emails TO verified email addresses
- This is why the confirmation email to `raphael.mansuy@gmail.com` fails

## Current Status After Fixes

‚úÖ **What's Working Now**:
- Contact form submissions are being received
- Emails to `contact@elitizon.com` are working (because it's verified)
- Next.js configuration warnings are resolved

‚ö†Ô∏è **What's Limited**:
- Confirmation emails to users fail if their email isn't verified in AWS SES
- This is expected behavior in sandbox mode

## Solutions for AWS SES Issues

### Option 1: Request Production Access (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to AWS SES Console**:
   - Navigate to Amazon SES in your AWS Console
   - Go to "Account dashboard"
   - Look for "Sending quota" section

2. **Request Production Access**:
   - Click "Request production access"
   - Fill out the form explaining your use case
   - AWS typically approves legitimate business use cases within 24-48 hours

3. **Benefits of Production Access**:
   - Send emails to ANY email address (not just verified ones)
   - Higher sending limits
   - No restrictions on recipients

### Option 2: Add Email Addresses for Testing (Development Only)

If you want to test confirmation emails during development:

1. **Go to AWS SES Console**
2. **Navigate to "Verified identities"**
3. **Add email addresses**:
   - Click "Create identity"
   - Choose "Email address"
   - Enter your test email (e.g., `raphael.mansuy@gmail.com`)
   - Click "Create identity"
   - Check your email and click the verification link

### Option 3: Disable Confirmation Emails (Quick Fix)

The contact form already handles this gracefully now - it will:
- ‚úÖ Always send the main contact form email to your business
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try to send confirmation email, but won't fail if it can't
- ‚úÖ Still show success message to the user

## Testing Your Setup

I've created a test script for you. Run it to check your AWS SES configuration:

```bash
node scripts/test-ses-config.mjs
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check your environment variables
- ‚úÖ Test AWS credentials
- ‚úÖ Show your sending quota and limits
- ‚úÖ List verified email identities
- ‚úÖ Send a test email

## Verification Steps

After making these changes:

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check that warnings are gone**:
   - You should no longer see the NODE_ENV warning
   - You should no longer see the next.config.ts warning

3. **Test the contact form**:
   - Go to `/contact`
   - Submit a form
   - Check that you receive the email at `contact@elitizon.com`
   - The confirmation email may not work (this is expected in sandbox mode)

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **‚úÖ Request AWS SES Production Access** (most important)
2. **‚úÖ Set environment variables in Netlify/Vercel**:
   - Don't include `NODE_ENV` (let the platform set it)
   - Include all AWS and email configuration variables
3. **‚úÖ Test email sending in production environment**
4. **‚úÖ Monitor AWS SES usage and set up billing alerts**

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test your contact form - it should work for receiving messages
2. **Short term**: Request AWS SES production access if you want confirmation emails
3. **Long term**: Consider implementing additional features like:
   - Email templates in SES
   - Bounce and complaint handling
   - Rate limiting for form submissions

## Need Help?

If you continue to have issues:

1. Run the test script: `node scripts/test-ses-config.mjs`
2. Check the AWS SES console for any additional error messages
3. Review the server logs for detailed error information

The contact form should now work correctly for receiving messages, even if confirmation emails are limited by sandbox mode.
