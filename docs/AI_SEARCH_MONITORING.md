❌ Avoid: "We deliver excellent results for our clients."
```

#### Structure Information Hierarchically

```markdown
# Main Service Category

### 2. Enhanced Metadata for AI

#### Semantic HTML5 Tags

```html

  >
    <span itemprop="name">ELITIZON Ltd</span>
  </span>
</div>
```

### 3. FAQ Optimization for AI Queries
