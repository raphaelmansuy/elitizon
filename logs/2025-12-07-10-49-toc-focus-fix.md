# 2025-12-07-1049_toc_focus_fix

## What was done

- Adjusted `TableOfContents.tsx` to wrap the scrollable list with padding so focus outlines are no longer clipped by `overflow-y` containers.
- Added consistent focus-visible ring styles, `aria-current`, and transparent borders to the TOC buttons to stabilize the selection indicator.
- Ran `npm run lint` to verify the changes; lint completed with pre-existing warnings in Mermaid components.

## What went well

- The issue reproduced quickly by reviewing the TOC structure, so the fix was scoped to a single component.
- Tailwind utilities made it straightforward to express focus-visible ring and border adjustments without custom CSS.

## What went wrong

- Google Search access was temporarily blocked, so I had to fall back to DuckDuckGo and direct resource fetches to gather accessibility guidance.

## Lessons learned

- When adding focus states inside scrollable containers, leave interior padding or use inset rings to prevent clipping around the first and last items.
- Keeping a transparent border in the default state avoids layout shifts when toggling emphasis styles.
