# 2025-12-04-13-28_merge-remove-netlify-ci

## Action

- Merged `chore/remove-netlify-ci` into `main` locally and pushed `main` to `origin`.

## Changes

- Cleaned and removed Netlify CI & config files, deleted Netlify docs, redirect files, build scripts, and updated docs in the PR.

## Result

- PR #12 has been merged into `main`.
- The remote branch `chore/remove-netlify-ci` remains on origin (left in case you want to keep history or delete via GitHub UI). If you want, I can delete the remote branch now.

## Next steps (optional)

- Delete remote branch `chore/remove-netlify-ci` via `git push origin --delete chore/remove-netlify-ci`.
- Remove Netlify app/integration from GitHub org or Netlify dashboard to stop external Netlify checks (if present).
