# 2025-12-04-13-40_delete_remote_branch

## Action

- Deleted remote branch `chore/remove-netlify-ci` from origin.
- Deleted local branch `chore/remove-netlify-ci`.

## Result

- Remote branch removed: `origin/chore/remove-netlify-ci` (deleted).
- Local branch removed: `chore/remove-netlify-ci` (deleted).

## Notes

- The PR for this branch had already been merged into `main`. Deleting the remote branch is a final cleanup step.
- External Netlify checks can still appear until the Netlify dashboard/GitHub integration is unlinked (this requires repository admin/vendored service access).
