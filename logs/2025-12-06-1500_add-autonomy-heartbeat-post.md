# 2025-12-06-1500_add-autonomy-heartbeat-post

## What was done

- Added new blog post MDX: `content/blog/autonomy-heartbeat.mdx`.
- Verified frontmatter fields match `src/lib/blog/types.ts` requirements.
- Ran type-check, lint, and a production build — site built successfully and static pages generated including `/blog/autonomy-heartbeat`.

## Files changed

- content/blog/autonomy-heartbeat.mdx (new)

## What went well

- MDX content integrates well with existing mermaid rendering and blog layout.
- Build completed successfully and the new post is included in static generation and the sitemap.

## What went wrong

- Nothing notable — everything passed cleanly.

## Lessons learned

- The blog system is flexible; adding MDX posts is straightforward with appropriate frontmatter.

## Next steps

- If desired, author can add a cover image and mark `featured: true` to highlight the post on the homepage or in curated lists.
